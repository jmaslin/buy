<h2>About</h2>

<!-- Brief website description -->
<p>A way to find out how much money you are saving over time, and what that money
can buy you. Our main goal is to show you the time value of money, or specifically, how much more can be bought by waiting and saving up.</p>

<p>By telling us what you make per pay period, and what percentage you would like to spend, our website will show you various products depending on the length of time you save.</p>
